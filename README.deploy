Both the source code and various other directories are maintained in this Git
repository. Directories needed to run the website are:

    my-env/ - The Virtual Environment.
    static/ - All static files such as CSS, images, and JS.
    media/ - Any file uploaded by the user (unused at the moment).

For each directory, the contents are not checked into Git. Only the empty directory is.
